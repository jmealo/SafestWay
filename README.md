#SafestWay
####Making walking safer, one step at a time
SafestWay is a mobile app that provides safe walking routes based on crime data. SafestWay is comprised of an easy to deploy Node.JS backend and a PhoneGap-based mobile app. It has been built from the ground up to encourage deployment anywhere that OpenStreetMap and crime data is available.

##Installation
An automatic installer script is provided for the following operating systems:
* OSX (10.7-10.9)
* Ubuntu 12.04
* FreeBSD 9.3 (Preliminary)
* SmartOS (Preliminary)

**The SafestWay installer targets platforms that are not [officially supported by Project OSRM](https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM/wiki/Building%20OSRM).**

This means that although you could conceivably use an unsupported platform to prepare the requisite data for SafestWay, the routing server (Project OSRM) may not run. **If you plan on running a full instance of SafestWay we recommend using OSX or a Debian-based Linux distribution**
